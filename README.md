# Linkedin_Scrapper
### Specially thougt for latin people searching for a job overseas.

A scrapper to filter the jobs you need.
This scrapper specifically filter out companies that doesn't hire people from latin america.


To use this scrapper you'll need to:
1. Make a file named keys.txt, where you'll store your credentials. In the first line you put your linkedin mail and in the second line you put your password. An example can be found at keys_example.txt
2. Get your job query. To do this go to the jobs section on linkedin. Put your job title and all the filters that you're interested in and press enter. Next you'll copy the resulting url and paste it on the third (our fourth or fifth) line of the keys.txt file. You can put as many querys as you want.
3. Run the script (this requires that you use chrome as your predetermined browser)
4. ???
5. Profit! Now you have filtered the jobs that you like and from companies that you know have hired other latinos. In the folder 'jobs' there'll be a file with all the jobs that meet your requirements and that hire latins. I recommend to reapeat this whole process once a day :).
